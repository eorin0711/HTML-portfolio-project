<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> 
  Hello, My name is Eorin. I'm currently working in a hospital as a registered nurse. 
  But at the same time I'm learning about HTML. The reason why I'm learning HTML and other programming languages is that I want to become a programme, and I want to create my own game, useful application. 
  Also one of my dreams is I want to own my company oneday. As it would be an IT company, which can create whatever people need.
  I know this is little bit unreal, but this is 2am after work and I'm really tired but also I really want to quit my current job!
  I hate hospital. I'm pretty sure that nobody would read this, but I can't tell bad things about my job on the internet.
  But the bottom line is I hate my job and hospital and every single thing, person involved with hospital setting. 
  Maybe I just go to bed and sleep and stop being crazy. </br>
  Okay, anyway this was me rambling something unsensed. See you!
